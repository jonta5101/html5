	<!-- 
		test for localstorage, yep -> no yep here because HTML5 supports it, nope -> load our polyfil.js to support localstorage in this browser.  This is better than just loading the script, less to send to the browser, faster loading pages.
	
		NOTE: these files are loaded asyncrnously...so you can not assume the files are present as they might not have loaded yet.  Use the COMPLETE option which tells it to run your functon after the scripts have loaded.
